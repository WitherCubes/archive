The origin of idli is unknown and yet to be discovered. Some say that idli first originated from the far south of India, which was known as Kumari Kandam. Others say that idli originated from Kerala.

This is an healthy breakfast because idli is cooked using steam and easily digests. It is loaded with iron and contains a good amount of fibre. Sambar is made with multiple vegetables which is also healthy. This is a perfect energetic breakfast for a person.
