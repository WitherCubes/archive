<h1 style="text-align: center;">Idli and Sambar</h1>

<p>Any Tamil person can't forget idli and sambar in their life. Idli and sambar is the staple diet for any Tamil family. It is also the most popular and famous food in Tamil Nadu. The sambar is a delicious stew made with lentils, spice powder, quick cook veggies &#38; herbs whereas idli is made up of rice batter. When combined and eaten it will taste the most delicious and feel like living in heaven.</p>

<p>The origin of idli is unknown and yet to be discovered. Some say that idli first originated from the far south of India, which was known as Kumari Kandam. Others say that idli originated from Kerala.</p>
<p>This is an healthy breakfast because idli is cooked using steam and easily digests. It is loaded with iron and contains a good amount of fibre. Sambar is made with multiple vegetables which is also healthy. This is a perfect energetic breakfast for a person.</p>
