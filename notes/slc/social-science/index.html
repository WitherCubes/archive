					## Artificial Intelligence
					**Artificial Intelligence** (also called as AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines like natural intelligence displayed by humans. Machines learn to think by themselves to operate.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## How does Artificial Intelligence work?
					Machines are constantly trained with adequate data to form algorithms and solve the problem which is also called machine learning.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Simple Example of Machine learning
					If a machine is trained with more than 100 images of you, it can purely identify you from anyone else. This AI is used in face detection for unlocking smartphones, smartlocks, etc.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Why use Artificial Intelligence?
					AI is mainly used for automation as of today. Simple tasks that humans could do manually can be done quick by machines. This increases productivity and more job can be done at once.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Day to day examples of AI
					- Voice Assistants (Google Assistant, Siri, Alexa)
					- GPS (Location)
					- Automatic Brightness in Mobiles

					## Advantages of AI
					- It doesn't require frequent breaks and refreshments as like human beings.
					- Machines can be programmed to work for long hours and can able to perform the job continuously without getting bored or distracted or even tired.
					- It can think much faster than humans and can perform multi-tasking to obtain the best results.
					- Machines don't get medical illness and can work in hazardous areas.

					<h2>That Means AI is awesome right?</h2>
				</section>

					<h2>NO!!!</h2>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Disadvantages of AI
					- It costs more to implement machines to do tasks which can be done for cheap by humans.
					- Machines lack creativity because it only collets data of a certain type and can't think a different way of doing the task.
					- It can risk to mass unemployment because small wage workers will be replaced easily by machines.
					- Machines may overtake human society in the future.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Conclusion
					Artificial Intelligence is not bad but can't be used in every scenario. We can't totally rely on AI for now because it is just the beginning of AI, but it can change in the future.
