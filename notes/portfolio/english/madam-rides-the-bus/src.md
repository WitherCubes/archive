## Introduction about Valli

Valli is an eight-year old girl, who did not have friends to play with and so she would spend her time by looking at the outside affairs going on the street. Her favourite part was to look at the bus that passed by her village every hour.

## The Bus

Valli's favourite part was to look at the bus that passed by her village every hour. It gave her endless joy to look at the new set of passengers each time the bus crossed by.

## Valli's desire

Gradually, even Valli wished to travel by bus. Soon, the wish turned into a desire and therefore, she made it her mission to fulfill it. She started listening to the conversations between her neighbours who frequently travelled by bus and in the process, would ask a few careful questions here and there to collect more information like the bus fair and where is the destination of the bus. She controled her temptations for saving money andd one fine day, she took the bus during it’s not very busy hours.

## Bus Journey and the People

She refused to take any help from the conductor or fellow passengers. It was an amusing sight for everyone to see such a small girl all alone acting like an adult. The conductor was of the joking sort and thus, referred to Valli as a grown up ‘madam’. The grown-ups advised Valli to not stand in her seat, and asked her a bunch of questions which annoyed Valli a lot.

## The Cow

She enjoyed seeing what was going on outside and the sight of a running cow in the middle of a road was abruptly a funny scenario for her. She didn't know the horrible future of the cow it was going to face.

## The return journey

Upon reaching the town, she refused to get down the bus because she was too afraid to do so alone. While returning, she carried extreme enthusiasm until she saw a cow lying lifeless on the road. It was the same cow that was so joyous previously. Valli got terrified at the fact that how a creature so full of life can instantly turn into something horrible. She sat down silently for rest of the journey.

## Valli's Aunt

Upon reaching home, she found her mother and aunt talking about the endless possibilities in the world outside. Valli affirmed to what her mother was saying leaving both of them astonished. She then justified her reaction by mentioning that she was casually agreeing to what her mother was saying.

## Message from the Lesson

I don't know. Maybe if Sreenivas replies to my message and Hemrithan reduces his anger, I will update this section.
