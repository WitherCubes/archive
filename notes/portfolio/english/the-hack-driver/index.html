<h2>Character sketch in the story My Lost Dollar</h2>

<h3>Stephen Leacock</h3>

<p>Stephen Leacock is depicted as kind, brave and honest. He is quite effective in his behavior. He made attempts for the society so that when people take money from the lender, they take it as a responsibility to return it.</p>

<h3>Todd</h3>

<p>Todd was a careless fellow and lived in his own way and he was also a very forgetful person. He owed a dollar from the author and the time asked was 12 months however since he was a forgetful person he forgot to pay the dollar back and his friend(author) tried to remind him through incidents and not directly because he was a friend of the author. However the author had belief in his friendship with Todd and was assured that he would return the dollar back.</p>
