<h2>Animals and their abilities</h2>

<h3>Killer Whale</h3>

<p>Orcas, also known as killer whales, are among the worldâ€™s most easily recognized marine mammals. The largest member of the dolphin family, orcas are highly intelligent and social animals, spending their lives in groups or pods where they hunt together and share responsibility for raising young and taking care of the sick or injured.</p>

<h3>Golden Eagle</h3>

<p>Golden eagles use their speed and sharp talons to snatch up rabbits, marmots, and ground squirrels. They also eat carrion, reptiles, birds, fish, and smaller fare such as large insects. They have even been known to attack full grown deer. Today, golden eagles are protected by law.</p>

<h3>Lion</h3>

<p>Lions prey on a large variety of animals ranging in size from rodents and baboons to Cape (or African) buffalo and hippopotamuses, but they predominantly hunt medium- to large-sized hoofed animals such as wildebeests, zebras, and antelopes. Prey preferences vary geographically as well as between neighbouring prides.</p>
