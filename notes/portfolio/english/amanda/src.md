## Rapunzel Story's Summary (By Hitesh Mohan)

Once, a lovely couple had a baby girl who was stolen by a sorceress. She was named Rapunzel. The witch lived in a tower which is too high and solitary. Rapunzel's hair was so long that nearly was equal to the height of the tower. Rapunzel would put her hair down and the sorceress would climb through it to the top.

One day a prince heard Rapunzel singing and found someone on the tower. He hid near a bush and saw the witch climbing on the hair. He tried the same way and both got married. When the witch came to know this, she cut Rapunzel's hair and threw her out of the tower. However the prince heard Rapunzel singing and found her down the tower. Now the witch was stuck on the tower, while the couple lived happily.
