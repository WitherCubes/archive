## Do not Have to Accept Everything

Gautam Buddha preached from place to place and shared good thoughts. He would help others to overcome the sufferings of their lives. People would be very happy to hear his words. That is why everyone used to like him very much. But there were some people who were jealous of Gautama Buddha.

Once, Gautam Buddha was traveling with his disciples, then a person came to him and started abusing Buddha. Even after hearing all this, Mahatma Buddha did not react. He remained calm and silent. In such a situation, the man again abused Gautam Buddha and started saying bad things about his ancestors, but still Mahatma Buddha did not give him any response and he kept calm.

Seeing all this, his disciples and the people around him were wondering why Mahatma Buddha is not giving any answer to that person?

After some time the person calmed down on his own. Then, the Buddha said, “If someone gives us a gift, it is up to us whether we take it or not. If we accept it, it comes to us. Whereas if we don’t accept it So it goes to the same person who gave the gift. Similarly, it is up to me to accept or not to abort this person. We should never react immediately. We should always calm down and think about right or wrong. It helps to avoid the worst and also gets rid of troubles. “

After hearing all these things of Buddha, that person became embarrassed and immediately fell at Buddha’s feet and started apologizing to him. The Buddha forgave him and went ahead.
