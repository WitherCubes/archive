<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Fill a large pot about half or 3/4th full with water.</li>
<li>Salt the water profusely. The rule of thumb is that water for boiling pasta should taste as salty as the sea.</li>
<li>Bring water to a rolling boil.</li>
<li>Now add pasta.</li>
<li>Keep it boiling, but decrease heat as it tries to overflow.</li>
<li>Wait until pasta is at the preferred softness (see below), then strain it.</li>
<li>While the pasta is sitting in your strainer, you may add basil leaves or other herbs and aromatics. I also recommend taking a knob or so of room temperature butter and add it in and stirring it, melting it into the pasta.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="how-long-should-pasta-be-cooked-">How long should pasta be cooked?</h3>
<p>The often recommended way to cook most pasta is <em>al dente</em>, which often means &quot;slightly undercooked,&quot; or with a subtle firmness that makes it still substantial.
Cooking pasta more than that is no great crime,
but if you keep it in there for <em>too</em> long, it&#39;ll become mush.</p>
