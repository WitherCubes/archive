# Baked Mostaccioli

## Ingredients

- 24 oz or 1 jar of Fradiavolo Sauce ([Victoria](https://victoriapastasauces.com/product/fradiavolo-sauce/))
- 1 box Mostaccioli Rigati or Penne Rigati ([Ronzoni](https://www.google.com/search?q=mostaccioli+rigati&tbm=shop))
- ~8 oz shredded Mozzarella Cheese ([Poly-O](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Polly-O-Mozzarella-Cheese-Chunk-with-Whole-Milk-16-oz-Pack/10448265))
  - I've found that pre-shredded cheese doesn't taste as good as shredding it right before cooking.
- 2x 2 quart (8") baking dishes or 1 large baking dish (see picture below)

## Directions

1. Bring a pot to a boil and [cook pasta](pasta.html) for 6 minutes (very al dante).
2. Put pasta and sauce in baking dish(es) and mix well.
3. Cover pasta and sauce generously with grated cheese until you can't see the pasta.
4. Bake at 350°F / 175°C for 20 minutes
   - Or 375°F / 190°C for 15 minutes on convection bake.
